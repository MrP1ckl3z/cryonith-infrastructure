## 🎯 Recommendation

### **Start with Basic If:**
- You're new to Pi/Linux administration
- Testing the concept before committing
- Limited budget or hardware
- Simple trading strategies

### **Go with Enhanced If:**
- You have production trading plans
- Plan to scale beyond single Pi
- Want professional-grade monitoring

## 🔄 Hybrid Approach

**Strategy**: Start with Basic, migrate to Enhanced as you grow

1. **Phase 1** (0-3 months): Basic setup for testing and development
2. **Phase 2** (3-6 months): Enhanced setup when revenue reaches $5K/month
3. **Phase 3** (6+ months): Multi-node Enhanced setup for scaling

This approach minimizes risk while ensuring you have a clear upgrade path as your trading operation grows.
